# GitHub Education

If you try a program through [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com), write about your experience here.

## Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io) is a free text editor that integrates with GitHub. It's an extremely versatile program. You can edit the source code to add any feature you'd like, or you can install pre-made packages. It works very well with GitHub desktop--there's even a button in GitHub desktop that opens Atom to the repository you're viewing.

## SendGrid

[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) allows you to send form emails to people who sign up for your mailing list. More details coming soon.
