## How to Raise Money

### Restaurant Fundraisers

See [`fundraising/fundraising-ideas.md`](../fundraising-ideas.md).

### Summer Camp!

We could run a summer camp for kids interested in coding!

#### Pros

- Tons of money
  - Speech & Debate does this and earns enough to pay for travel costs.
- Adds credibility to Hack Club
  - Makes us more trustworthy--might lead to additional donations from parents.
- [Resources available](https://github.com/hackclub/camp)
  - Hack Club ran "Hack Camp" for two years (2015/2016), we can use & adapt their stuff for our own club. They had ten days of coding, we can pick the best lessons for a smaller camp.
- Potential Recruitment
  - If any people come in that are interested & coming into high school, we can snag them early.

#### Cons

- Logistics
  - None of us have run a summer camp before--we'd have to rely heavily on administartion for things like waivers, legal liability, etc.
- Costs
  - We have to reimburse MHS for building rental, cleaning, HVAC, etc. However, those costs will be more than covered by the class fees.

### After-School Enrichment

We talked about running an after-school program for kids. All fees for the program would go back into Hack Club. This is basically a scaled-down version of summer camp--see the pros/cons above.

### Tutoring

We can offer computer (or programming) tutoring for a small fee. We have people knowledagble in almost every subject of computers, so we have a wide range of talents available.
