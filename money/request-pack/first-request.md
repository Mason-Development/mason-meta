# Cold Calling Businesses

Make sure you replace everything that looks like %%NAME%% with the appropriate information. However, you can customize it more. For instance, in my example, I changed the order of a few sentences to make it flow more naturally. Don't let it look like a batch letter!

## Fundraiser Request

Hello! My name is %%FULL_NAME%%, and I'm with Mason Hack Club at Mason High School. Mason Hack Club is a student-run chapter of the global non-profit Hack Club. Our goal is to teach as many students as possible the fundamentals of coding & other STEM careers. Although the San Francisco headquarters of Hack Club provides us with the valuable resource of a knowledgeable base of people to help us learn, we receive no financial aid from them. As such, I wanted to reach out to you and see if you would be willing to host a fundraiser with us. The money that you provide will go towards a few important projects of ours:  

Firstly, we would be able to purchase hands-on demo products (for example: robots!) for outreach programs like math & science nights at intermediate schools in the area. Secondly, we could purchase paid software packages, allowing us to experiment with the latest industry-standard technologies & prepare ourselves for working in an ever-changing industry. And finally, we would be able to save for bigger monetary commitments, such as a "Hack Camp" in the summer for any interested students or travel costs to a programming workshop.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you! If you have any more questions, feel free to email our club at masonhackclub@gmail.com, or, email me directly at %%EMAIL%%. Thank you!

### Optional: replace the last line of the first paragraph ("The money that you provide...") with this to "suck up" to them

We know that people at MHS love to %%VERB%% at %%COMPANY%%. Personally, I love %%COMPANY%% because of %%WHY_YOU_LOVE_COMPANY%%. We're actually reaching out to you because of the amount of attention %%COMPANY%% gets at MHS. We think that partnering with you will bring a lot of students into your business, and it would let us use the money for a few important projects we have:

As such, I wanted to reach out to you and see if you would be willing to host a fundraiser with us. We know that people at MHS love to eat at Chipotle. Personally, I love Chipotle because of the food--my favorite is a carnitas burrito with both types of beans and a side of chips & guac, and I can't think of anyone who wouldn't take a chance to get food from you. In fact, that's actually why I'm reaching out to you--the amount of attention you get at MHS! We think that partnering with you will bring a lot of students into your business, and it would let us use the money for a few important projects we have:
